"""run_dataset: drives :class:`AgentFlowEngine` over a list of Tasks for ``rllm eval``.

Eval shares the same execution engine as training. The eval-specific
concerns — per-task verifier resolution and per-task sandbox lifecycle —
are encapsulated in :class:`rllm.hooks.SandboxTaskHooks` and threaded
into the engine via its :class:`TaskHooks` protocol.

The gateway sits in front of every LLM call so flows that ``return None``
(framework-cookbook style) get their Steps populated from gateway-captured
traces, exactly as they do at training time.

    """Run a list of :class:`rllm.types.Task` objects through :class:`AgentFlowEngine`.

    Per-task: the engine creates a gateway session, runs the agent flow
    against the session URL, fetches traces, enriches the Episode, then
    runs the per-task evaluator (or the fixed ``evaluator`` if set).

    Args:
        gateway: Optional pre-started gateway. When ``None``, this function
            constructs an :class:`EvalGatewayManager` pointing at
            ``base_url`` and tears it down on exit. When provided, the
            caller owns the lifecycle (used by ``rllm.cli.eval`` so the
            gateway can stay up across multiple runs).
        evaluator: Bind a single evaluator to all tasks (CLI's
            ``--evaluator`` flag; the hooks' ``FixedEvaluation`` policy).
            When ``None``, ``SandboxTaskHooks`` resolves a per-task verifier
            from the task's ``[verifier]`` config.
        sampling_params: Resolved sampling params from the CLI, attached to each
            gateway session so the gateway enforces them on every LLM call. ``None``
            or empty → flows/harnesses keep their own params.
        attempts: Independent rollouts per task (pass@k). Each task is expanded
            into ``attempts`` adjacent copies; the engine numbers sibling rollouts
            ``task_id:0..n-1`` (training's GRPO convention) and the EvalResult
            groups them back by task to compute ``pass_at``.

    Returns ``(EvalResult, list[Episode])``.
