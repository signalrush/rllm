    advertises (~5/s). That shape is why a batch of ~192 concurrent creates can
    sail through while ~256 trips it — the burst fits the bucket, then the extra
    creates outrun the refill and Modal's client spends the batch in
    retry/backoff (the repeated rate-limit warnings).

    This mirrors that bucket on our side, gating every create through the one
    chokepoint (:meth:`ModalSandbox.__init__`): up to ``burst`` go through
    immediately, after which creates are paced at ``rate``/s. Tuned under
    Modal's envelope, the startup burst is absorbed and only the long tail is
    throttled — so creates queue locally instead of failing-and-retrying, with
    little added latency for batches within the burst.

    Thread-safe; token accounting is serialized under the lock while the wait
    sleeps outside it, so concurrent callers self-correct on the next loop and
    never collectively exceed ``rate``. Scope is per-process, which matches the
